		<h3 id="cssFiles"><strong>B) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>I'm using a few CSS files in this theme. These files are stored in folder named "<b>css</b>".</p> 

		<h5>clear.css</h5>
		<p>This file contains specific stylings to reset all browser default styles, so we can avoid different rendering.</p>  
		
		<h5>common.css</h5>
		<p>This file contains specific style sheets which can be used in some other project also. For example for fixing content left or right, making text bold, italic, underline etc.</p>
		<h5>main.css</h5>
		<p>This file contains specific stylings for this site.</p>  
				
		<p>If you have any additional question about how to customize some part on template, fill free to contact us.</p> 

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="javascript"><strong>C) JavaScript</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>This theme imports these Javascript files.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>myHint</li>
			<li>main</li>
		</ol>
		  
		<ol>
			<li><b>jQuery</b> is a JavaScript library that greatly reduces the amount of code that you must write.</li>
			<li><b>myHint</b> is our jQuery plugin, which is used for displaying default hint in input elements, and in text area.<br />
			This is a example how you can use this plugin:
			<pre>$('#your_jQuery_selector').attachHint('Here you can put default value for wanted element');</pre>
			 </li>
			<li><b>main</b>, as this name already says is our main JavaScript file. This script contains code for countdown, for sending email notification via ajax when someone sing up on page, for sending contact message to site owner, validating user input, displaying twitts, and binding all these events together on page.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3 id="psdFiles"><strong>D) PSD Files</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>Landerous is pretty clean and minimal template and you basically don't need advanced Photoshop skills to edit this theme. The most things you can easilly change via CSS. Anyway, you'll need .PSD files for background, logo and social icons change. In the "Landerous_PSD" folder, you'll find two .PSD files.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Landerous.PSD</li>
			<li>Landerous - Social Icons.PSD (stumble, vimeo, flickr, linkedin, facebook, skype, twitter, rss icons included)</li>
			</ol>
		<p>If you want to change background, color, you'll need to change two JPEG's. Let's take "Landerous_LightBlue" theme as example from here. So, in the folder "Landerous_LightBlue\images" you'll find two JPEG's you need to change. First one is "dark_blue_bg.jpg" and second (lighter) one is "light_blue_bg.jpg". Open both  files in the Photoshop and paint them in desired color. After that action, just replace "dark_blue_bg.jpg" and "light_blue_bg.jpg" with new ones that you jst create. And that's how you'll get new background color. Same procedure is for "contact_bg.png" and "subscribe_bg.png".
If you want to change the logo,  just replade current one "Landerous_LightBlue\images\logo.png" with your own.</p>
		<p>If you don't like the rocket graphic, you can change that with your own photo or illustration as well.</p>
